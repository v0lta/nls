\section{The Brusselator}
\begin{align}
u_t &= D_u u_{xx} + A - (B + 1)u + u^2 v, \\
v_t &= D_v v_{xx} + Bu - u^2 .
\end{align}
The above equations describe molecule concentrations during a coupled reaction. They are known to exhibit patterns.  

\section{Stability of the steady state}
At the steady state $u_t = v_t = u_{xx} = v_{xx} = 0$. Thus following equations remain:
\begin{align}
0 = A - (B + 1)u + u^2v, \\
0 = u(B - uv). \\
\end{align}
From which $u_0 = A$ and $v_0 = B/A$ is deduced.
