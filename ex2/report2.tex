In this report the effects of Wind on a poorly designed bridge will be explored.
\section{Equation of Motion}
The model for the structure leads to the following equation of motion:
\begin{align}
0 &= - F_I - F_d - F_e + F_{dr} \\
0 &= -m \ddot{y} - r\dot{y} - ky + \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 a C(\alpha) \label{eq:motion}.
\end{align}
Where $C(\alpha)$ is a nonlinear function.
\section{Linear Analysis}
$C(\alpha)$ is defined as a sum of several odd powers of $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
C(\alpha) = A_1 \alpha - \underbrace{ A_3 \alpha^3 + A_ 5 \alpha ^5 - A_7 \alpha^7.}_\text{$\approx 0$ for small $\alpha$.} 
\end{equation}
for small $\alpha$ additionally the approximation $\alpha = \frac{\dot{y}}{V}$ is given. Plugging into ~\ref{eq:motion} yields:
\begin{equation}
0 = -m \ddot{y} + (\frac{1}{2}\rho V a A_1 -  r)\dot{y} - ky. 
\end{equation}
Which may be rewritten in terms of two first order equations:
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}
\dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{pmatrix} &=
\begin{pmatrix}
	\frac{\frac{1}{2}\rho V a A_1 -  r}{m} & - \frac{k}{m}  \\ 
	1 & 0
\end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
Setting the derivatives to zero the fixed point $\mathbf{x}_1^* = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^T$ is obtained. As a linear approximation as already taken place the Jacobi-matrix is identical to the system matrix given above. Thus for the trace $\tau_1$ and determinant $\triangle_1$ at the fixed point the following equations are obtained:
\begin{align}
\tau_1 = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\rho V a A_1 -  r}{m} & - \frac{k}{m} \\
\triangle_1 = \frac{k}{m}.
\end{align}
Assuming $(k \wedge m) > 0$ the nature of the fixed point is determined by the trace. The critical value will occur for $tau_1 = 0$, therefore it my be found from:
\begin{equation}
0 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\rho V^2 a A_1}{mV_c} - \frac{r}{m}.
\end{equation}
Solving for $V_c$ leads to:
\begin{equation}
V_c = \frac{2r}{\rho a A_1} = 42.5985.
\end{equation}
When $m = 1, \; \rho = 1, \; r = 1 \; k = 100, \; a = 1$ and $A_1 = 100$. 
A plot for $\tau_1$ with respect for different values for $V$ is given in figure~\ref{fig:tau1}. As the determinant remains positive at all times the fixed point at the center changes from a stable to an unstable spiral at the critical wind speed $V_c$.

\section{Simulation of the non-linear System}
In this sections simulation will be attempted without linearization. Including all terms the following system of first order ordinary differential equations is obtained:
\begin{align}
\dot{y} &= z \\
\dot{z} &= -\frac{ky}{m} - \frac{rz}{m} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\rho V^2 a}{m} [ A_1\frac{z^1}{V^1} - A_3 \frac{z^3}{V^3} + A_5 \frac{z^5}{V^5} - A_7 \frac{z^7}{V^7} ].
\label{eq:nonLin}
\end{align} 
Equation~\ref{eq:nonLin} may be simulated in matlab using an explicit Runge-Kutta type solver (\texttt{ode45}). Results are given in figure.
