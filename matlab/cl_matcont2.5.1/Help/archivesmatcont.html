<p><b>Archives</b> are a set of files where MATCONT stores your dynamical systems 
  with all data specified for their analysis as well as the results of the analysis. 
  It contains the <b>database of Computed Objects and Curves</b> and the<b> database 
  of System Descriptions</b>. Logically, archives consist of a number of independent 
  units each of which contains all information related to one dynamical system.</p>
<p>The description of the dynamical system provided by the user includes the list 
  of the names of state variables, parameters, time and functions computing values 
  of the RHS. </p>
  
<p>MATCONT creates a corresponding <a href="odefile.html">ODEfile</a> that defines 
  the dynamical system and a <a href="../matlab_external/ch05matf.html">MAT-file</a> 
  which contains some <a href="#global">global variables</a>. Both files are saved in the <b>Systems</b> 
  directory (which is a subdirectory of the <a href="#matcontroot">matcontroot</a>) as &lt;name of the system&gt;.m 
  and .mat file. This directory contains also a MAT-file <i>session.mat</i> in 
  which the GUI-information is stored as it was left when exiting MATCONT in the 
  previous session. When restarting MATCONT this file is loaded and the exit situation 
  of the previous session is restored.</p>
<p>Information on computed objects and curves is stored as MAT-files by MATCONT 
  in a subdirectory &lt;name of the system&gt; which is subdirectory of the directory 
  &lt;name of the diagram (default: 'diagram')&gt; which is on his turn a subdirectory 
  of the directory <b>Systems</b>. A <a href="curve.html">curve</a> contains coordinates 
  of points and additional data required to redraw and recompute the curve.</p>
<p><a name="global">The</a><b> fundamental global variables</b> saved in that 
  MAT-file are the MATLAB structures <i>gds</i> and <i>cds</i>. The structure 
  <i>gds</i> contains the information concerning all windows open at a certain 
  time and collects the information fed into the system by the GUI. <i>cds</i> 
  is needed in the GUI to store a computed curve from whose points a new curve 
  is to be started. Both <i>gds</i> and <i>cds</i> contain fields in which computational 
  options are stored. The other global variables are specific to certain types 
  of computed curves. They are used to collect information from the computational 
  routines so that it can be stored in the database. In particular,<i> eds</i>, 
  <i>lpds,bpds </i>and <i>hds</i> contain global information specific to the continuation 
  of equilibria, limit points, branch points and Hopf points, respectively. These 
  global variables also allow computational routines to share information.</p>
<p>MATCONT creates all necessary files automatically. The user does not deal
  with  them directly.</p>
<p>(<a name="matcontroot">The root directory</a> of MATCONT is the location of 
  the Master program <i>matcont.m</i> . The other files are kept in a number of 
  separate directories.)</p>
