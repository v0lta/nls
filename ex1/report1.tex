\section{The equations}
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{n} = GnN - kn. \\
\dot{N} = -GnN - fN + p.
\end{eqnarray}


\section{First Order Analysis}
Assume that the number of excited atoms remains quasi-static. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{N} \approx 0. \\
\Rightarrow \dot{n} = Gn \cdot \frac{p}{Gn + f} - kn. \label{eq:oneParam}\\
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{Linear Stability analysis}
In the two dimensional case fixed points are at the intersections of the first derivative with the real axis. Thus the can be found by solving $\dot{n}=0$. Leading to the problem:
\begin{equation}
0 = n ( \frac{Gp}{Gn+f} - k)
\end{equation}
Which has the zeros $0$ and $\frac{p}{k} - \frac{f}{G}$. To learn more about the nature of the fixed points one has to set the derivative of \ref{eq:oneParam} to zero. Using the Quotient rule the expression: 
\begin{equation}
\ddot{n} = \frac{Gfp}{(Gn+f)^2} - k   
\label{eq:secondDiv} 
\end{equation}
is obtained. A fixed point is stable if the second derivative is negative. Likewise it is unstable if the second derivative is positive \footnote{Strogatz, p.25}.
Evaluating the second derivative for the fixed point a zero leads to $\ddot{n}(0) = \frac{Gp}{f} - k$ which leads to a values of $p_c = \frac{fk}{G}$. Thus the fixed points becomes unstable if $p > p_c$.
