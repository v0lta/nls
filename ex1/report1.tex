\section{The equations}
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{n} = GnN - kn. \\
\dot{N} = -GnN - fN + p.
\end{eqnarray}


\section{First Order Analysis}
Assume that the number of excited atoms remains quasi-static. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{N} \approx 0. \\
\Rightarrow \dot{n} = Gn \cdot \frac{p}{Gn + f} - kn. \label{eq:oneParam}\\
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{Linear Stability analysis}
In the two dimensional case fixed points are at the intersections of the first derivative with the real axis. Thus the can be found by solving $\dot{n}=0$. Leading to the problem:
\begin{equation}
0 = n ( \frac{Gp}{Gn+f} - k)
\end{equation}
Which has the zeros $0$ and $\frac{p}{k} - \frac{f}{G}$. To learn more about the nature of the fixed points one has to set the derivative of \ref{eq:oneParam} to zero. Using the Quotient rule the expression: 
\begin{equation}
\ddot{n} = \frac{Gfp}{(Gn+f)^2} - k   
\label{eq:secondDiv} 
\end{equation}
is obtained. A fixed point is stable if the second derivative is negative. Likewise it is unstable if the second derivative is positive \footnote{Strogatz, p.25}.
Evaluating the second derivative for the fixed point a zero leads to $\ddot{n}(0) = \frac{Gp}{f} - k$ which leads to a values of $p_c = \frac{fk}{G}$. Thus the fixed points becomes unstable if $p > p_c$.

\subsection{Nondimensionalization}
To reduce the amount of parameters and simplify the analysis the dimensions are non-dimensionalized. In a first step scaling parameters are introduced:
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} \;\; x = \frac{n}{\alpha} \;\; y = \frac{N}{\beta}. \\
\Rightarrow t = n\tau \;\;  n = x\alpha \;\; N = y\beta \;\;  
\end{eqnarray}
Using the chain rule for the derivatives leads to $\dot{n} = \frac{dn}{dt} = \frac{dn}{d\tau} \cdot \frac{d\tau}{dn} = \frac{dn}{d\tau} \cdot \frac{1}{\gamma} = \frac{dx}{d\tau} \cdot  \frac{\alpha}{\gamma} = \hat{x} \frac{\alpha}{\gamma}$. 
Following a similar derivation for $\hat{y}$ and substituting leads to:
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{x} = Gxy\beta \gamma - kx\gamma \\
\hat{y} = -Gx\alpha y \gamma - fy \gamma + p\frac{\gamma}{\beta}.
\end{eqnarray}
Now the equations may be simplified by setting groups of coefficients to one. Starting with $p\frac{\gamma}{\beta} = 1$ to ensure non-dimensionality. For the other terms it is beneficial to have the coefficients in front of the cross terms $xy$ since these will end up on the diagonal of the Jacobi matrix. Thus $k\gamma = 1$ and
